# Titanic_Classification
This Python code uses logistic regression to predict Titanic passenger survival. It preprocesses the data, encodes categorical features, and splits it into training and testing sets. The model's performance is evaluated with accuracy and a classification report. For production, further data preprocessing and feature engineering are needed.
